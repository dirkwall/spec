# Specifications for Site Reliability Engineering with Keptn

To support site reliability engineering with Keptn and to enable the self-healing use case, Keptn relies on two configurations called as:
* [Service Level Objectives (SLO)](#service-level-objectives-(slo))
* [Remediation Action](#remediation-action)

---

## Service Level Objectives (SLO) Configuration

The *Service Level Objectives (SLO)* configuration specifies a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by a service level indicator (SLI). An SLI is a defined quantitative measure of some aspects of the service level. Next to SLIs, an SLO consists of a service filter that uniquely identifies a service, and evaluation success criteria that depends on the selected comparison strategy. Hereâ€™s an example of a minimal SLO - the details to each configuration item are described below.

```yaml
spec_version: '1.0'
scope:
  endpoint: "ItemsController.addToCart"
comparison:
  compare_with: "single_result"
  include_result_with_score: "pass"
  number_of_comparison_results: 3
  aggregate_function: avg
objectives:
  - sli: response_time_p95
    pass:
      - criteria:
          - "<=+10%"
          - "<1000"
    warning:
      - criteria:
          - "<=800"
total_score:
  pass: "90%"
  warning: "75%"
```

#### Scope
SLOs are defined per service and can be scoped by using key-value pairs. Any key-value pair described in the `scope` section is passed to the respective SLI provider (e.g., prometheus-sli-service or dynatrace-sli-service). By default the keys project, stage, and service are set by Keptn to the respective values $PROJECT, $STAGE, and $SERVICE. These values can also be overwritten within the SLO configuration. 

For instance, the prometheus-sli-service can make use of the scopes as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  custom-queries: |
    cpu_usage: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="$PROJECT-$STAGE",pod_name=~"$SERVICE-primary-.*"}[5m]))
    response_time_p95: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by(le) (rate(http_response_time_milliseconds_bucket{handler="$ENDPOINT",job="$SERVICE-$PROJECT-$STAGE-canary"}[$DURATION_SECONDS])))
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-sli-service-config-sockshop
  namespace: keptn
```


#### Comparison
By default, Keptn compares with the previous values of the SLIs. The **compare_with** configuration parameter controls how many previous results are compared: *single_result* or *several_results*. The **include_result_with_score** configuration parameter controls which of the previous results are included in the comparison: *pass*, *pass_or_warn*, *all* (default, also used if not specified). For example,

```yaml
comparison:
  compare_with: "single_result"
  include_result_with_score: "pass"
  number_of_comparison_results: 3
  aggregate_function: avg
```
means that the current result is only compared to the last result that passed. Whereas, if

```yaml
comparison:
  compare_with: "several_results"
  include_result_with_score: "pass_or_warn"
  number_of_comparison_results: 3
  aggregate_function: "avg"
```

the current result is compared to the average of the three previous results that had pass or warning as a result.

#### Objectives
An objective consists of a **sli**, a **pass** criteria, an optional **warning** criteria, an optional **weight** criteria and an optional **key_sli** flag. `pass` represents the upper limit up to which an evaluation is successful. `warning`, if defined, describes the border where the result is not pass and not fail, and a manual approval might be needed to decide. `weight` can be used to emphasize the importance of one SLI over the others. By default, `weight` is 1 for all SLIs and can be overwritten. The weight is important for calculating the score later. The `key_sli` flag can be set to true meaning that the objective is not met if this SLI fails.

The following example demonstrates how the objectives work. Assume the following comparison strategy and SLI objective.

```yaml
objectives:
  - sli: response_time_p95
    pass:
      - criteria:
          - "<=+10%"
          - "<1000"
    warning:
      - criteria:
          - "<=800"
    weight: 2
    key_sli: true
```

Further assume, that in the previous evaluation error_rate was 5%. The upper limit for pass is 5.5% (5 + 10%). The following list shows the evaluation results for all possible error_rate values.
*   pass: <= 5.5%
*   fail: > 5.5%

#### Scoring
An evaluation for *pass* counts for one point, an evaluation for *warning* half a point, and an evaluation for *fail* zero points. The default weight of an SLI is 1 and can be overwritten. The maximum score is the sum of the weights of all SLIs.

The actual evaluation result is divided by the maximum score and gives the `total_score` in percent. For example, the maximum score is 92 and the evaluation result is 85 - the `total_score` is 92.39% (85/92*100).

The pass and warning criteria for the `total_score` use the logical operator ">=" by default.
